On September 15, 1916, during the First World War, during the Battle of Sommy, the British used tanks for the first time in the military practice of mankind - 32 pretty primitive and slow cars that did not even have time to move synchronously with the movement of infantry, with their appearance caused panic in German.
In the spring of 1915, the British Admiralty created a "Land Ship" Committee, which was tasked with creating an armored combat vehicle to protect the continental coastal bases.In the summer of 1915, a contract for the development of such a machine was granted to the production of agricultural machinery "William Foster & Co".
The construction of the prototype began on August 11, and on September 9, the first copy of the tank made a trial mileage across the plant.The tank was named "Little Willie" ("Baby Willie"), and in the fall it appeared his advanced version - "Big Willie" ("Healthy Willie"), 49 specimens of which called "Mark I" came to the British military units next year.
A 28-ton tank crew consisted of eight people, two of whom were managing it, two were arrows, two more of their assistants;The officer managed the tank with two more mechanics.Two 57 mm guns and two or four 7.7 mm machine guns were used as weapons.The speed of the tank was about 6.5 km/h, and the margin did not exceed 40 kilometers.The location of the tank crew was not separated from the engine, which was why the temperature inside the housing reached 50 degrees and there were cases where the first tankers lost consciousness, poisoning carbon monoxide and ovapora.The 8-mm armor had to protect the tank crew from small arms, and leather chain chain and helmet was issued to protect against random fragments of tankers.
On July 1, the offensive of the Anglo-French troops on German positions began in the area of the Somma River (France).The attack was preceded by a weekly art preparation, which, however, did not destroy the defensive positions of the Germans and on the first day of battle of 100 thousand British soldiers died twenty thousand, and forty thousand were injured.The following days were also ineffective and were accompanied by large losses - 100 French or English military were killed for each seized ten meters of German positions.
And even on September 15, when tanks were used for the first time in the history of wars, tanks were not changed.However, despite the imperfection of the tanks, most of which were lost during the bad maneuverability during the German counter-offensive, General Douglas Heig, commander of the Allied troops on Sommi, ordered several hundred more excellents of the newest weapons.With the exception that the Battle of Sommi turned over part of the German forces that participated in the battles under verdins, the result of the Anglo-French offensive was tragic-125 square miles (about 300 square kilometers) were captured and lost, wounded and missing600,000 French and English and 650 thousand Germans.The first tank battle took place on April 24, 1918 under the town of Willer-Bretonne (Northern France)-three advancing German A7V tanks came across a group of three British Mark IV tanks, two of which were equipped only with machine guns to support infantry.As a result, they were damaged, and the third British tank, equipped with a gun, managed to pick up one tank of the enemy, after which the other two German tanks retreated.On the same day, German and British tanks were repaired and continued fighting.
